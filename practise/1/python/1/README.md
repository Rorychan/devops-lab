#Installing Python
If you are using `MAC` or `Linux` python should already be installed on your machine. You can check it by running `python3 --version`

If you are using Windows, please go to the [Official python page](https://www.python.org) and download latest python version

After that create a `hello_world` directory and a `main.py` file inside it.

Paste `print('Hello World!')` inside the file and in your terminal go to this directory and execute next command

- on Mac or Linux `python3 main.py`
- on Windows `python main.py`

Safe this result and move to the next lesson.
